        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h2>Introduction.</h2>
        <p>Website Owner. Smart ERC is the owner of this website (â€œSmart ERC Website").
          Smart ERCs can be contacted by mail at 30 N Gould St, Ste R, , Sheridan, Wyoming 82801,
          by phone at [855-855-9365], or by e-mail at service@financialmatch.com. This online privacy
          notice discloses Smart ERCs information practices for this Smart ERCs Website,
          including what type of personal identifiable information is requested in order to make a
          purchase, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared. Note that other
          Smart ERCs websites may be governed by privacy notices containing different information
          practices applicable to those sites.
        </p>
        <p>Website Visits. In general, you can visit on the Smart ERCs Website and by doing so agree
          to this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, and the collection of certain personal information
          collected electronically for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Policy, including without
          limitation personal and company financial data collected in connection with the Employee
          Retention Credit services provided by Smart ERCs. In addition, Smart ERCs does keep
          track of the domains from which people visit us.
        </p>
        <p>Website Transactions. At times, Smart ERCs will need personal information regarding a
          customer or a prospect. For example, to process an order or provide a subscription, Financial
          Matchs may need to know a customer's name, mailing address, e-mail address and credit card
          details. It is Smart ERCs's intent to inform you before Smart ERCs collects personal
          information, such as user's name and/or address on the Internet. If you tell us that you do not
          wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, Smart ERCs will
          respect your wishes.
        </p>
        <h2>Personal Information That May Be Collected.</h2>
        <p>Identifying Information. In order to access designated subscriber services and/or restricted
          areas within the Smart ERCs Website, Smart ERCs will request a user to provide
          certain personal identifying information, which may include: legal name, postal address, e-mail
          address, screen name, password, telephone number, facsimile number, method of payment, and,
          if applicable, credit card number. Smart ERCs may request additional information necessary
          to establish and maintain customer's account.
        </p>
        <p>Service Quality Monitoring. Some Website transactions may require a customer to telephone
          Smart ERCs, or Smart ERCs to call the customer. Smart ERCs will not contact
          you by telephone without your prior consent, except to confirm an order placed online and/or to
          inform a customer of the status of such order. Customer should be aware that it is Financial
          Matchs's practice to monitor, and in some cases record such calls for staff training or quality
          assurance purposes.
        </p>
        <p>Information from Children. Smart ERCs does not sell products or services for purchase
          by children, and will not knowingly collect or post information from a child under the age of 18
          without the involvement of a parent or guardian. To the extent reasonably possible, Financial
          Matchs will notify the child's parent or guardian at the e-mail address provided by the
          prospective customer, alerting the parent or guardian to the child's use of the Website and
          providing instructions as to how the parent or guardian can delete the child's registration from the
          Website.
        </p>
        <p>Lost or Stolen Information. If a customer's password is lost or stolen, the customer should
          promptly notify Smart ERCs in order to enable Smart ERCs to cancel the lost or stolen
          information and to update its records with a changed password.
        </p>
        <p>Chat Rooms, Forums and Bulletin Boards. If customer participates in an Smart ERCs
          chat room, discussion forum, or posts messages to an Smart ERCs bulletin board, customer
          should be aware that the information disclosed and shared will be broadly available to other
          persons, both inside of and/or outside Smart ERCs, who have access to that chat room,
          forum or bulletin board. Some individual Smart ERCs chat rooms, forums or bulletin boards
          have additional rules and conditions regarding participation. Also, participant's expressed
          opinion is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of Financial
          Matchs.
        </p>
        <p>Links to Other Websites. An Smart ERCs Website may contain links to other websites.
          Smart ERCs is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those other
          Websites.
        </p>
        <h2>Uses Made of the Information.</h2>
        <p>Limited Uses Identified. Personal information collected by Smart ERCs will be used by
          Smart ERCs for the following purposes: for statistical analysis of customer's behavior; for

          of Smart ERCs website; for marketing related services from Smart ERCs and from
          third parties in which customer may be interested in Smart ERCs's judgement.

          collected, used, analyzed and/or processed by Smart ERCs, or selected third parties on
          Smart ERCs's behalf, for marketing and other business purposes. Before Smart ERCs
          uses the information, however, Smart ERCs will notify customers and offer customers the
          opportunity opt-out if a customer wishes not to have personal identifying information used in this
          way.

          customers to help Smart ERCs better understand the types of advertising or promotions that
          are most appealing to Smart ERCs's customers. After it is collected the information is
          aggregated so it is not identifiable to a specific individual. If, however, customer would prefer
          that these companies not collect such information, please mark an "x" on the opt-out option box
          herein provided.
        </p>
        <h2>Disclosure of the Information.</h2>

          conducts business. Some countries may provide less legal protection for customer personal
          information.
        </p>
        <p>Mergers and Acquisitions. For the purpose of developing and expanding its business, Financial
          Matchs may share, rent, sell or buy business assets. In such transactions, customer information is
          generally one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event Smart ERCs is acquired,
          customer information will be one of the transferred assets.
        </p>
        <p>Agents. Smart ERCs employs or engages other companies and individuals to perform
          business functions on behalf of Smart ERCs. These persons are provided with personal
          identifying information required to perform their functions, but are prohibited by contract from

          information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing

        </p>
        <p>Affiliated Businesses. Smart ERCs works closely with affiliated businesses operating
          website stores, providing services or selling products on each other's Websites. These businesses
          identify themselves to customers. Customer information related to a transaction with an affiliated
          business is shared with that affiliated business.
        </p>
        <p>Marketing Analysis by Third Parties. Smart ERCs reserves the right to disclose to third
          parties personal information about customers for marketing analysis; however, any information
          disclosed will be in the form of aggregate data that does not describe or identify an individual
          customer.
        </p>
        <p>Disclosure to Governmental Authorities. Smart ERCs releases personal identifying
          information when Smart ERCs believes release is appropriate to comply with law, to
          enforce Smart ERCs agreements, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Financial
          Matchs customers. Smart ERCs may also release such information in an exchange of
          information with other companies and/or organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and
          credit risk reduction.
        </p>
        <h2>Use of Computer Tracking Technologies.</h2>
        <p>No Tracking of Personal Information. Smart ERCs's Website(s) are set up via cookies and
          other means to track, collect or distribute information not entered by visitors. Through website
          access logs Smart ERCs does collect clickstream data and HTTP protocol elements, which
          generate certain kinds of non-identifying site usage data, such as the number of hits and visits to
          our sites. This information is used for internal purposes by technical support staff for research
          and development, user analysis and business decision making, all of which provides better
          services to the public. The statistics garnered, which contain no personal information and cannot
          be used to gather such information, may also be provided to third parties.
        </p>
        <p>Use of Cookies. Smart ERCs, or its third party vendors, collects non-identifiable and
          personal information through the use of various technologies, including "cookies." A cookie is
          an alphanumeric identifier that a Website can transfer to customer's hard drive through
          customer's browser. The cookie is then stored on customer's computer as an anonymous tag that
          identifies the customer's computer, but not the customer. Cookies may be sent by Financial
          Matchs or its third party vendors. Customer can set its browser to notify customer before a
          cookie is received, giving an opportunity to decide whether to accept the cookie. Customer may
          also set its browser to turn off cookies; however, some Websites may not then work properly.
          Use of Web Beacon Technologies. Smart ERCs may also use Web beacon or other
          technologies to better tailor its Website(s) to provide better customer service. If these
          technologies are in use, when a visitor accesses these pages of the Website, a non-identifiable
          notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by Smart ERCs or by its suppliers.
          Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies. If customer does not want cookie
          information to be associated with customer's visits to these pages, customer can set its browser to
          turn off cookies; however, Web beacon and other technologies will still detect visits to these
          pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie
          information and are disregarded.
        </p>
        <p>Collection of Non-Identifiable Information. Smart ERCs may collect non-identifiable
          information from user visits to the Smart ERCs Website(s) in order to provide better
          customer service. Examples of such collecting include: traffic analysis, such as tracking of the
          domains from which users visit, or tracking numbers of visitors; measuring visitor activity on
          Smart ERCs Website(s); Website and system administration; user analysis; and business
          decision making. Such information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." Smart ERCs
          or its contractors may use this data to analyze trends and statistics.
        </p>
        <p>Collection of Personal Information. Smart ERCs collects personal identifying information
          from customer during a transaction. Smart ERCs may extract some personally identifying
          information about that transaction in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-
          identifiable information, such as clickstream data. This information is used and analyzed only at
          an aggregate level (not at an individual level) to help Smart ERCs understand trends and
          patterns. This information is not reviewed at an individual level.
        </p>
        <h2>Information Security.</h2>
        <p>Commitment to Online Security. Smart ERCs employs physical, electronic and
          managerial procedures to safeguard the security and integrity of personal information. Billing
          and payment data is encrypted whenever transmitted or received online. Personal information is
          accessible only by staff designated to handle online requests or complaints.
          No Liability for Acts of Third Parties. Smart ERCs will exercise all reasonable efforts to
          safeguard the confidentiality of customer personal information. However, transmissions
          protected by industry standard security technology and implemented by human beings cannot be
          made absolutely secure. Consequently, Smart ERCs shall not be liable for unauthorized
          disclosure of personal information due to no fault of Smart ERCs including, but not limited
          to, errors in transmission and unauthorized acts of Smart ERCs staff and third parties.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>Your California Privacy Rights. Beginning on January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section
          1798.83 permits customers of Smart ERCs who are California residents to request certain
          information regarding Smart ERCsâ€™s disclosure of personal information for their direct

          Smart ERCs reserves its right not to respond to requests submitted other than to the address

        </p>
        <p>Californiaâ€™s privacy laws require a company to provide notice to California users of
          their rights to receive information on to which entities their information was shared for
          marketing purposes.
